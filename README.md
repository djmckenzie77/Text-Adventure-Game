# Text-Adventure-Game
a basic text based adventure created in python

This is an introduction to coding with python project for my Computer Lit class. The project is a based off the book "Make Your Own Text Adventure with Python" by Phillip Johnson.

I have created folders corresponding to the different chapters. Each chapter has homework assignments as well as the different elements of the game. Each chapter progresses the game a bit more.
